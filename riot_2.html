      As we arrive there, I can't help but get mad at what I see: the entire floor is designated just as church. In Submitia a floor corresponds to an entire neighborhood. In this exact space are usually crammed thirty to forty apartments; and here we are, in an enormous space, all comfortably sitting on fancy chairs. No wonders my mother loves it so much: I'm starting to believe it's like escaping the reality of life, for all of them.

        The function has already started, so we take our places standing in the back of the room. From where we are we see a mass of people of all ages: not only our parents and grandparents (the few of them who still live) are here to listen to this priest; many young people like me are attending, alongside a substantial group of children. They have no reason to be here at all: they will only be fed with information they will not be able to understand, and they will interiorize it forever.
