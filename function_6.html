      I'm really starting to see it, now. Hearing this makes it incredibly clear: this is how you create an entire class of docile workers and devotees.
        <br><br>
        For example, pick a submitian family: two to three grandparents, two parents and at least two children. They live thanks to the income brought by the hard work of the parents, which only get 5 staters a week each: 40 staters a month for a family of seven. They have to cut on everything: food, clothes, school supplies, school itself if the money is not enough. They live in a crappy apartment that would probably fit two people, and they would be crammed in it too; they are not allowed to go upper that five floors from their current section, which is only on the 26th floor. You would think they'd be pissed, right? At least angry at the government, rioting for better life conditions, asking for more money, telling eachother how unfair this treatment is.

        But they don't. And they dont because he is selling this crap to them. Worse: he gives it away for free.
