      «<b>I must... Where are you...</b>»
        <br><br>
        Two people from the front row climb the stairs of the stage to reach him. One of them touches his arm, asking him if he's ok. Suddenly, at the touch of the woman, the priest seems to come to his senses.
        <br><br>
        «<b>Oh mother, can you fetch me some water, dear? Please, everybody, don't worry. I must had a pressure drop.</b>»
        <br><br>
        The woman gives him the water and he drinks it all in one sitting. He moves from his position, and it's in this moment that I see something I would have never thought to see on his vest. I squint as I don't believe my eyes: on the wrist of the left sleeve is embroided the symbol I saw this afternoon on the back of the device I received. It's the exact same: the string, the halfmoon, the arrow.
        <br><br>
        «<b>Let's all pray to Mother Gloom, shall we?</b>»
