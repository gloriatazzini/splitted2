    <i>May 14th, 10.45 am pm - Submitia’s secret black market</i>
    <br><br><br>
    I go down the final escalator and I reach the metal door that opens the way to the market. Yesterday night, after the function ended in that violent way, too many questions started filling my head. Who were those people? Were they there for a reason? Where they controlling us? Who was behind their actions? What if we got hurt: would somebody have taken care of us? Or would they just have had us disappear?
    <br><br>
    So I came back here. I know I will find the guy that was with me the whole time. He said his name is Mayhar, and I am pretty sure he is of Iranian heritage, so I will look for him in the south area of the market, where many Iranian families have businesses. I ask around, and the merchants point me towards a hidden shop behind a corner of the 135th building. I enter and ask for him to the girl at the small counter.
    <br><br>
    «<b>And who's asking?</b>» she asks with an inquisitive attitude.
