    He probably doesn't remember me, although we even said goodbye before going home yesterday. He looks way more confused then I thought he would be.
    <br><br>
    «<b>Who's this girl Mayhar?</b>»
    <br><br>
    «<b>I tell you Mith, I have never seen her before.</b>» he tells her, then he turns back at me «<b>I'm sorry, were you at the riot yesterday? I really don't know to what information you are referring to.</b>»
    <br><br>
    «<b>Ehm, we talked during the riot, remember? You told me we would have to dig a little in this matter?</b>»
    <br><br>
    He shakes his head in sincere apology. «<b>I'm really sorry, what riot?</b>»
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    «<b>What do you mean "what riot?" you dumbass, you left me here working a double shift because you had to go riot for my rights, for which I thank you very much, you were not helpful at all...</b>»
