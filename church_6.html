      I am confused, and impressed by how quickly his attitude changed.
      <br><br>
      «<b>Yes... I... will go now.</b>»

      On my way back home, I sense a feeling of oppression on my chest. It becomes harder to breathe at every step down the stairs. My head spins a little, so I am forced to stop on the landing and lean on the walls; I close my eyes and take some deep breaths to calm down. I can't understand my reaction, even though his words rest in my mind as I try to give a sense to them. But it's not that. It's not what he said, it's they way he accessed this other dimension of his mind while talking to me. It's not what he said, it's everything he didn't, the implicit, the left unsaid. The entire world of information I have to shine a light on.
