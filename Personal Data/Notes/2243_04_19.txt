Hello, again. 
Our journey has continued in a fluent way, getting to mid-Submitia without much problems, even if we already knew that this area was simple to travel. 
Indeed, each submitian can climb up a limited number of floors by right, while we can go down as much as we like.   
It's the rule of the hierarchy: you can only climb up if you have reached an enough wealthy position to be worthy of living in a better condition.
We, submitians, are the last of the list. Dimitians and Editians are what we aspire to be, being able to live a decent healthy life.
Is it too much to ask for?
Either way, our path will be more difficult now, I will write here when we will find a good and safe spot.
