Back here with a good news: not only we reached the 25th floor, we got to climb five more floors thanks to a big crowd of people protesting in the 22nd floor, that distracted the guards, keeping them busy.
The best thing is that from here we can already feel the air difference, even if just slightly, and it seems to be able to breathe better.
Now I am dead tired, so I am going to rest for the night, as the path is still long and I don't want to be a burden for the others... 
See you in a month, more or less.
