From Submitia to the top of the world. Or, at least, of Aether... 
Today at 9pm we started our journey to Editia to live a better life and hope for a bright future. 
We had to go to the black market first to recollect our counterfeit ID documents, so that some floors will be escalated quickly and without any problem.
The plan is to reach at least the 25th floor by the end of February, to exploit the chill breeze as an excuse to cover up our faces and wander around without any suspect.
Until then, goodbye.
