As we were thinking, moving around here in Dimitia is way harder than before. 
Luckily, we are still covered by the granting of our friend for some floors, until mid-Dimitia.
Then we will need to be extra careful, as we have witnessed an unwarranted violence towards our fellow Submitians from the guards, something that we heard of but never got to see with our own eyes.
Some days ago, while we were climbing with the elevator, another clandestine was trying to get in, but a guard caught him off guard and pushed him to the floor, starting to beat him even if he was not violent at all.
When the floorkeeper intervened, the guard spitted at the poor guy on the floor and muttered some racial slurs, adding that, and I quote "I wait for the day in which that damned fog will kill you all, rats".
I didn't really get the meaning behind the sentence, but the others started to talk between them in secret, so I let them be.
Either way, I wouldn't want to get involved in something like this.
