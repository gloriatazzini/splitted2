This is a whole new world, here in Editia. 
We reached the 183rd floor of Aether, now being almost at the top of it. 
There, we have been said that we will have a safe place for the first period, to accustom to the new life and new place. 
Then we will be able to get in contact with another person who can assure us a good job company to start with. 
If I don't sound happy about it, it's because I am not. 
My family is dying down there, my people. And I can't find myself being selfish in these times.
They are being slowly murdered by some organized group of editians, and I can't ignore this.
I will talk with the others about this, I want to go home and expose this organization.
Let's start a riot, let's fight for our roots.
