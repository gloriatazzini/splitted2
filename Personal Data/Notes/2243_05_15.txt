Good morning. 
It's just 4.30am but I couldn't sleep, so I thought to take advantage of it and keeping an eye on the surroundings in case of danger and in the meanwhile updating here.
I am writing from the 79th floor. How did we get here? Well, long story short, we got caught on having counterfeit IDs cards, but we could run away from the floorkeeper as he was a super old man.
He called the guards but we were long gone by then, hiding in an abandoned dirty and stinky room. But, we are here still, so it's no time for controversies.
As I was writing, after the accident with the floorkeeper, we had to find another solution to climb.
This was kindly offered to us by a smart little kid who showed us the way for the outer fire escape stairs. He showed us this passage that was not locked by the guards, that is recognizable by us "undergrounds" from a neon lamp painted in red.
It is also from where I am writing right now, by the way. 
I will go now, I hope to update here when we will be in Dimitia already.
