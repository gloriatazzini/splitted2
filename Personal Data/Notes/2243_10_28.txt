We are in mid-Editia.
In this last months C has started to act strange. She is out of her usual behaviour. 
She stays alone, wanders alone, disappears for all night long and reappears with blue bags under her eyes in the morning.
I am worried she might put herself in danger, or that she puts all of us in danger.
I have taken advantage of her absence to talk with A about my concerns.
He is now understanding my point, agreeing with me on wanting to act.
We will talk with her in a short while, hope she agrees.
