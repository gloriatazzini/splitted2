Long time no see.
We are almost at the end of Dimitia, with more consciousness on our miserable conditions.
I was hoping that our secret research would reveal that the rotten parts were just individuals, racist guards that thought to be superior than us.
Unfortunately, during this last part in Dimitia, we discovered some things that I preferred not knowing at all.
The system is rotten. We live in a corrupted society that wants to enslave the poor ones, tricking them into thinking that this is our role for life: being submitted to the others, not cultivating any hope for the future, or aspirations.
What we understood in the last month is that the government is linked to the miserable conditions of Submitia. Hell, it may be the cause of it.
We overheard many conversations among the dimitian guards and some people linked to the government and Editia, all talking about these secret reunions, and I quote, "to decide the destiny of Submitia".
They were taking on how they should find a way to control us and keep us sedated. 
I am now splitted: should we return home and warn everyone of the danger we are going to be put in or should we continue our journey and try dismantle it alone, as the others suggest?
Talking about the others, one is missing now... I guess she needed some time to process all these information.
