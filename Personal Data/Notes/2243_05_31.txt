We are in Dimitia, finally.
Yesterday evening we got to pass the border with Submitia with the help of an old friend of a friend, that granted for us and made us enter in Dimitia legally.
Well, we are not completely legal, but the guards have not questioned anything so we are out of trouble for now. 
With this passage, we are now nearer to the top, having already climbed half of the height of Aether.
We know that the following months will be harder than before, as here the guards are stricter and do not hesistate in putting you to jail or resending you to Submitia in zero time. 
For now, let's rejoice for this big milestone and enjoy the view from here.
