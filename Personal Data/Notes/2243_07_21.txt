We have reached mid-Dimitia, we are in the 137th floor. 
As I wrote, our path here in Dimitia until now has been covered, but now it has to continue illegally, as it was started.
From here, we can see that things seems balanced in all the senses: the buildings are neat, of different but classical architectures, maybe repetitive in the facades but I am no architect to judge.
Dimitians too are quite cool people: they have their average life, average home and average job. They seem content with this. And I would be too.
I talked with the others last night, giving voice to my concerns and trying to convince them in staying here: mid-Dimitia already is an excellent place to stay and build our future.
However, they dismissed me, saying that it's not only about our life that are are talking about, but the ones of all submitians.
They have been growing some suspects on the guards, who are controlled by the government: ever since that accident of racial fight we witnessed, we realized that they seem to know that Submitia is dying, as if it is meant to be all in a specific date.
The others want to exploit this journey also to shine a light on this matter, being able to travel to the top and collecting information in the meanwhile.
I hope this won't put us in too much trouble.
