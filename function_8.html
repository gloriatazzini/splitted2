      My mother looks at me. All the people sitting in front of me turn around to pierce me with judgmental eyes. The priest shuts up. At least it was worth it. He seems lost for a second, trying to figure out who was the person speaking: after wandering around with his look he finds me. He stares at me, incessantly. It's not something I said; I feel like he is reacting to my appearance, to the fact that it was me to say such things. I can see his arm starting to shake, not excessively, but certainly in a weird way.

        «<b>Don't...</b>» his head starts to shake too. «<b>Make... They...</b>.»

        <br><br>
