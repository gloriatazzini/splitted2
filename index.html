          My name is not important. Just know that I live here. I am a Submitian. <br>Let me tell you the story of how I came to this glorious hell this city has become.

        I was born on a field of rotten corn. I grew up there: running through the scrubs, wounded by their thorns. Life was stil good: the air was clean, we could drink the water without fearing for our life, we even had a pet lizard called Rusty.
        <br><br>
        <b>Then the sand storms arrived.</b> The desert ate everything within ten, exhausting years. The land that raised us with its dry arms had nothing left to give us.
        <br><br>
        I was smart enough to pack our bags and leave in January 2221. Everybody went towards the same direction: the capital. Hoards of immigrants, just like we were, flew into the city we now call <b>Aether</b>.

        Aether was crowded with human skanks of all types. The day we entered the city, two people tried to rob me. Me, <b>a pregnant woman</b>. Me and my husband were granted a place in an apartment on the 5th floor, only because of my special conditions: I would’ve paid my weight in gold not to be pregnant in that living hell.
        <br><br><b>That day the borders closed forever</b>, and everything and everyone who didn’t make it inside the city was left to die among the dunes of sand.
        <br><br>
        We lived in the campbase, we lived on the street, then in this crappy apartment. The only thing I understood right away was this one: I couldn’t leave. <br><b>My freedom didn’t exist anymore</b>.
        <br><br>They started to call all of us Submitians: we were the filthy product of the desert, a pile of slag delivered at the feet of a developing city, destined to become the unresting engine at its roots.
        <br><br>
        Everybody needed us. Nobody wanted us. <b>Nobody cared</b>.

        <b>Aether splitted</b>: we stayed here, on the bottom, in <b>Submitia</b>.
      <br><br>
      The middle class ran as fast as they could to the top: the higher your apartment was, away from the dirt of Submitians, the better chances at surviving you had. On top of us the class of <b>Dimitians</b> was born.
      <br><br>
      And on top of them went the only ones who had enough resources to build on the skeleton of the city to create a new one. Legends say they created crystal skyscrapers, shining in the sun, while we rot in the mold of the dark.
      <br> <br> They became the <b>Editians</b>: sent to the heavens to guard us all and create a better future for us, a future that still hasn’t come. They are the only ones that today can see the sky.

        I have one clear memory of the sky. I was running in the fields behind our house, following a kite my brother built that afternoon. The sun pierced my eyes through the ruffles of the red paper. And behind it, <b>the bright vastness of the blue sky</b>, anointed by some cloudy brush strokes.
      <br><br>
      Here we had to build a wall around Submitia. It’s 50 floors high, running through the whole perimeter of Aether. We needed it to protect us from the desert, to prevent the sand from burning our throats and lungs, the dusty winds from blinding us and the heat from consuming us.
      <br><br>But what it really did was <b>cutting us out of one of the only joys we could ever feel</b>: filling our eyes with the blue of the sky.
      <br><br>
      So we hold on to the last thing to cherish in life: the memories that will never come back, <b>because Aether stole them all</b>.

        So run, young one.<br><br>
        Or if you want to stay here, remember one thing:
      <br>
        Aether tries to breathe, <b>but we are choking</b>.
        <br><br>And so could you.
