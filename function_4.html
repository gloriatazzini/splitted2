      «<b>They died in the most honourable circumstances, because they were doing their job, and they were fulfilling their scope in the greater scheme of the world.</b>»
        <br><br>
        I feel phisically sick hearing these words. Why would we try and find an honourable reason for them to have died, when they were literally trapped under the weight of this entire city, without having a chance to run and survive?
        <br><br>
        «<b>Some people are implying that they shouldn't have been there. That if they hadn't been there, this tragedy would have been avoided. But let's not forget, beloved devotees, that everybody in this city has a role. And if you die fulfilling that role, you are doing the right thing.</b>»
